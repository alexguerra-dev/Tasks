# Tasks

-   [ ] Setup Jekle Site
    -   [ ] Figure out what to name is

Three things that I learned from this assignment:

1. The hard way to do things is not always the best way to do things.
2. I have a hard time focusing on one thing at a time.
3. I need to learn how to use the terminal better.
